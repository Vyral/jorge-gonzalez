You may be the rare type of person that looks forward to cleaning your home, but most people do not relate. Cleaning your house is a pretty easy task to procrastinate because it usually takes so much time and energy from your already busy lifestyle. Of course, everyone within your household enjoys a tidy living space, but no one is up for the job. Believe it or not, some things you can do right now to keep your home tidy and relaxing every day of the week\!

1. Everything has a place. Assign each item a place and ensure that everyone in your household knows where those items go. For example: Where do shoes go when your family gets home from work or school? Is there a place by the door or do they go in the bedroom? Create a designated area for those items, and your home will maintain organization throughout the week.
2. Create a chore list that assigns small chores each day rather than cleaning every surface in one day. For instance: Mondays can be the day everyone dusts their bedrooms, Tuesdays give someone the task of vacuuming the living area and so on. By doing a little now and then, you maintain your homes ability to remain a relaxing environment.
3. Make cleaning a family activity. It can be hard to get the kids motivated to clean their rooms, but when everyone in the household is doing their part, kids can quickly jump on board. Something you could start is "The five-minute pick-up game." Set a timer for five minutes each day and ask that everyone tidy up their space for five minutes. Setting a limit will not only keep you from a few meltdowns but will also save you so much time that you could be spending on the couch resting\!
4. Once a month go through your home and declutter a room. It's so easy to collect unwanted items that pile up in a closet to collect dust, but you can save yourself the stress later by organizing one room each month. Declutter by asking yourself when the last time you used the item, and if you plan to use it anytime soon. If you no longer have a specific use for the article, then donate it to someone in need.&nbsp;

As you take a few minutes during each day to clean your home, you will save yourself so much time throughout the week that you can spend enjoying time with your friends and family.
