No matter what’s going on in the world around us right now, some people need to sell their homes. With all the lockdown measures being taken across the country (and the world), you might wonder how selling a home would even be possible. Today I’ll share some key information you need to know about how to sell your home in the era of social distancing.

Given that most people are staying home, **the real estate process has had to largely become a virtual transaction.** That affects how Realtors market homes. So what’s the new normal? Well, if everything is going online, that means that the online marketing tools we use have to be enhanced. Buyers need to be able to get a good feel of the house before actually going to look at the property. That necessitates three things if you want the best exposure for your property:

1. Better photography
2. Better videos
3. A better virtual experience. 3D home tours, with the right tools, allow buyers to “walk through the house” online so they can see the property and all its corners. They can even allow buyers to take measurements of different spaces.

Showings have also had to change. For one, only serious buyers will be allowed to go to a showing. The new normal here involves **thoroughly disinfecting the property before and after each showing and keeping in line with social distancing**; this is especially important if the property isn’t currently vacant.&nbsp;

We have also been going through the house to open all the interior doors. Why? **So that we can instruct visiting buyers not to touch anything.** If everything is already open and available for inspection, there is no need for them to physically handle anything. Further, we do not shake hands or hug any of our clients. We also make sure that buyers come to the house wearing proper face masks, gloves, and shoe covers so as not to track anything into the home.

If you do need to sell your house, don’t worry; **right now is a great time to sell your home.** You can count on me to invest in the best measures to keep clients safe and healthy even as they finish their real estate transactions.

Don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or needs you have. In the meantime, keep yourself and your loved ones safe\!
