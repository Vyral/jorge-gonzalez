Do you need to sell your house as soon as possible? Maybe you need to relocate for a new job soon, or perhaps you just don’t want to draw out the hassle of a home sale. Whatever your reason is, you don’t need to worry. I have tons of experience helping homeowners sell their properties quickly. Here are three things I’ve learned that will help you sell as soon as possible without sacrificing your final sales price:

**1\. Prepare your home before putting it on the market.** The better your home looks, the more interest you’ll generate. Clean, declutter, and depersonalize before listing your home. That means you’ll need to put away your family photos and pack everything into boxes. I also recommend hiring a professional cleaner. They’ll be able to do the job faster and better than even the most motivated amateur. Once your home is in tip-top shape, buyers will be more likely to put in good offers sooner.

**2\. Take care of any small repairs upfront.** One of the most common issues that stalls a home sale is negotiations over minor repairs. If you want to avoid a drawn-out conversation with your buyer and their agent, take care of any issues before you list your house. Faulty light sockets, old door handles, and other minor problems should be addressed upfront. This way, the inspection and negotiation period can go as smoothly as possible.

**3\. Offer incentives to buyers.** If you want to sell fast while maintaining a high asking price, incentives are a great strategy to do it. Consider offering to pay your buyer’s closing costs, giving a repair credit, or including necessary appliances. Another popular incentive you can offer is a 2-1 buydown. This loan product reduces your buyer’s interest rate for the first two years of their loan for an upfront cost. If you offer the right incentives, many buyers will be willing to close quickly, even at a higher price.

A good agent should be able to help you implement these selling strategies and more to secure a quick sale. If you have questions about these points or anything else, just call or email me. I am always happy to help!
