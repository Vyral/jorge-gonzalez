Many homeowners are wondering how long it will take to sell, and the truth is, it depends on how you prep, price, and position your home. I’ve seen homes sit for months and others sell in just a few days, and the difference that I've seen so far is their strategy.

Just last month, I worked with a seller whose home had been listed for over 90 days with another agent. I made a few strategic adjustments, revised the pricing, and within 10 days, it was under contract. That experience was a clear reminder that timing is essential, but preparation makes all the difference. If you’re planning to sell this summer, here’s what you need to know so you can move forward with clarity and confidence:

**Summer market speed varies.** Most homes are going under contract within 15 to 45 days. However, these averages don’t tell the whole story. Homes that are well-presented and priced correctly can sell in a weekend, while those that are overpriced or in need of work often stay on the market longer. It’s not just about when you list but about how you show up.

**Buyers are motivated, but they expect value for their money**. There are plenty of motivated buyers out there, especially families trying to relocate before the start of the school year. But with interest rates still high, they have become more selective. They want homes that feel worth the investment, such as clean and move-in-ready properties. These listings tend to attract more interest and better offers, which is why they often don't stay listed for long. If your home feels like a project, be prepared for slower traffic and more negotiation.

**Your timing should align with your goals.** If you're planning to sell and buy, timing the sale correctly can make a big financial difference. Listing at the right moment and negotiating the proper timeline helps ensure you don’t end up scrambling to find your next home or carrying two mortgages.

**What does this mean for you if you're getting ready to sell?** Here’s a step-by-step approach to help you prepare strategically and move forward with clarity.

* **Step 1: Understand the local timeline.** In most areas, the average sale timeline is 15 to 45 days from listing to contract. But again, that’s just an average. The real timing for your home depends on your price, how well it’s presented, and the demand in your specific neighborhood. Some homes sell in a weekend, while others need a few extra weeks of polish and pricing strategy to attract the right buyer.

  &nbsp;

* **Step 2: Prepare like a pro.** Today’s buyers want clean, simple, and move-in-ready. To sell quickly and for top dollar, you want your home to feel inviting and well-maintained. That might mean decluttering, professional cleaning, a few cosmetic updates, or even light staging. Combine that with smart pricing, and you’ll likely see faster results, especially in summer when buyer urgency is high but selectivity is even higher.

  &nbsp;

* **Step 3: Align your sale with your bigger goals.** Selling a home isn’t just about getting to the closing table. It’s about where you’re headed next. If you’re buying another home, relocating, or downsizing, we’ll put together a clear plan that keeps things moving on your timeline. That includes everything from listing and showings to negotiations and closing dates.

Selling your home this summer comes down to having the right strategy in place. The market is active, but buyers are more discerning, which means your success depends on how well you prepare, price, and present your home. From understanding local timelines to making your home show-ready and aligning your sale with your next steps, each decision plays a role in how quickly and smoothly your home sells.
