Today I’m joined by two very special guests, my lovely daughters Lili and Ana. As some of you may know, we recently went to the Dominican Republic on a service trip with LIFO Missions, and we’re excited to tell you all about it.

I don’t know how much longer my beard is going to last because a month without shaving is very rare to me, but I know the memories that my daughters and myself made on this trip will last a lifetime. I’ve gone on trips like this with my sons before, and I was very excited to be able to take my girls on this one.
