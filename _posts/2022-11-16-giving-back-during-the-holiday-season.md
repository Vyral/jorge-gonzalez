We are once again in the fall, with the palm fronds drying up and falling to the ground here in South Florida. It’s the time of year to look back and be grateful for all of you and for the blessings that God has granted us.

This has been an amazing year for us, and we are so grateful for your support and referrals. **If we’ve worked with you, know that we are honored and pleased to have done so.**

This year, to give back during the holiday season, we are trying something new—**we’re partnering with Mision Santa Ana and St. Vincent De Paul to put together blessing baskets for those in need.** These will be baskets filled with food and a gift card for a turkey or ham so that people can enjoy a special meal during this time of year. Our partners are already gathering families in need of a blessing basket.&nbsp;

If you would like to be a part of this effort, please see the flyer at 2:12 in the video above for more information, or you can reach out to us by phone, email, or direct message, and we’ll give you more details.&nbsp;

**We are so thankful for all of you who have given us the opportunity to give back like this.** We thank you for your support and for trusting in us. Whether we helped you with a real estate transaction or you referred someone to us, we truly feel honored to serve our community.

If you have any questions, call or email us anytime. We hope you guys enjoy this time of year greatly, and always remember what you have to be thankful for. Happy Thanksgiving\!
