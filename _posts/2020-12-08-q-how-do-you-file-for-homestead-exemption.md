One of the perks of living in Florida is the fact that it’s a homestead state, and there are certain benefits that come with having a homestead. For example, you get protection from creditors and liability. **Most people, though, are attracted to one benefit in particular:** You can save money on your property taxes.

If you’re interested in filing for homestead exemption, **there are certain things you have to do in order and by a certain date.** You only have to file once, but you have to do it by March 1. Your property tax assessor or appraiser should have a form available on their website that you have to submit (along with all proper documentation).

In this application, you're declaring to the county assessor or appraiser that you’ve been living in your home as your primary residence as of January 1, and you have to prove this with certain documents. One of these is your driver’s license. If you don’t have a driver’s license, you can also use a Florida state identification card. In either case, these must show your updated address by January 1. If you’re a citizen and have a voter registration card, you’ll have to update that card with your correct address too by this date too. The same goes for the registration on your vehicle.&nbsp;

**Since we’re already into December, you need to get moving with these updates.** If you’re buying a house this month, you have a lot of work to do after the closing is finalized. If you’re closing during the last week of the year, you should head to the DMV right after the keys are handed over to your new home.&nbsp;

If you’d like more information about filing for homestead exemption or would like to start the process, here’s a link to the [Miami-Dade county appraiser’s office](http://www.miamidade.gov/pa/exemptions.asp){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and here’s a link to the [Broward County appraiser’s office](https://bcpa.net/homestead.asp){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you bought a house with me in 2020, I’ll also be sending you a link to an online form before March 1.&nbsp;

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to call or email me. I look forward to hearing from you, and I hope you enjoy the rest of the holiday season.
