The market has changed. Homes aren’t selling as quickly as last year, and buyers are taking their time. With more listings available, it’s not enough to simply put your home on the market and hope for the best. If your home isn’t prepared, it could sit longer than expected or face price reductions. The good news is that you can avoid that. With the right steps, you can still sell quickly and for a strong price. Here’s what I recommend for every seller who wants to stand out in today’s market:

**1\. Fix small problems before you list.** Buyers are cautious right now. Higher interest rates have made them more careful with their money. They’re looking for homes that don’t need extra work. Minor repairs—like patching walls, fixing a loose handle, or replacing outdated light fixtures—can make a big difference. These details show that your home is move-in ready and reduce the risk of inspection delays later.

**2\. Make your home feel clean and open.** You don’t need to invest in a full renovation. What matters most is that your home looks clean, well-cared-for, and easy to picture living in. Start by clearing clutter and putting away personal items. Keep the decor simple and neutral. Add light touches that make the space feel warm, like fresh towels or flowers. Buyers notice how a space makes them feel; a clean, calm home always makes a stronger impression.

**3\. Plan for kids and pets during showings.** If you have children or pets, showing your home can be a little tricky. But it’s important to give buyers the best experience possible. Try to be out of the house during showings, and keep the space quiet and tidy. When buyers feel comfortable, they stay longer, often leading to better offers.

Selling your home this summer is still a great opportunity. But it takes the right plan. If you’d like help preparing your home and developing a strategy, reach out today. I’ll guide you through the steps that help your home stand out and sell with confidence.
