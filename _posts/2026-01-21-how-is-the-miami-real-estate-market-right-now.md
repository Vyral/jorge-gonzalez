If you’re thinking about buying, selling, refinancing, or even staying put this year, the 2026 housing market affects you. Just last week, I met with a couple trying to decide whether to move or refinance. They’d been watching the news, but every headline seemed to say something different.

So, before you make any decisions, here are the four things you really need to know, based on what I’m seeing, hearing, and helping clients navigate every day.

**1\. Interest rates are easing.** Rates are trending down slowly, but enough to improve affordability. Realtor.com forecasts [mortgage rates averaging around 6.3%](https://www.realtor.com/research/2026-national-housing-forecast/?utm_source=chatgpt.com){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in 2026, which is slightly better than last year’s numbers.

With the Fed’s rate drop back in December, we’re expecting to see:

● More buyers coming back

● Homeowners exploring refinancing options

● A little more breathing room compared to the high-rate years

We’re not going back to 3% rates, but the pressure is easing.

**2\. Inventory is growing.** Realtor.com expects [for-sale inventory to rise nearly 9%](https://www.realtor.com/news/trends/housing-forecast-2026-mortgage-rates-affordability-improves/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} in 2026, which means more choices for buyers and a more predictable landscape for sellers.

However, this increase will not be evenly distributed. Some regions will still face tight supply, while others will move toward a more balanced market. For many people, this will be the first year where local conditions matter far more than national headlines.

If you’re thinking about making a move, your specific neighborhood, not the national averages, will tell you what to expect. This is the year to pay close attention to what is happening in your ZIP code.

**3\. Move-in-ready homes are the most competitive.** One of the clearest trends in 2026 is the growing demand for move-in-ready homes. Many homeowners have chosen to remodel rather than sell, limiting the number of updated homes available for sale.

As a result, clean, modern, and well-prepared homes often attract immediate attention. Buyers are willing to move quickly for a home that feels finished, and sellers who invest in small updates can see meaningful returns. In contrast, homes that need repairs or updates tend to sit on the market longer this year.

**4\. AI is changing real estate.** AI is playing a bigger role in real estate than ever before. According to the NAR Realtor Technology Survey, [over one-third of REALTORS® are already using AI tools](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/research-reports/realtor-technology-survey){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

These tools may be able to help with the following:

● Analyze pricing trends

● Identify strong comparables

● Estimate demand

● Match buyers with homes that fit their needs.

AI can provide fast and detailed data that supports better decision-making. However, AI cannot replace local knowledge or the human judgment needed to negotiate, understand context, or create a strategy.

Think of it this way: *AI provides information, but a trusted professional helps you use that information wisely.* The best outcomes in 2026 will come from using both powerful tools and experienced guidance.

After several years of uncertainty and constant shifts, the 2026 housing market has finally settled into a more stable pattern. Rates are easing, inventory is improving, and buyer and seller expectations are becoming clearer.
