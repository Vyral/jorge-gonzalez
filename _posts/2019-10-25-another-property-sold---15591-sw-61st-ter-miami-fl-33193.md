15591 SW 61st Ter, Miami, FL 33193

&nbsp;

6 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms offer plenty of space for a large family\! This home was built to accommodate families that love spending time together\! In addition to the 6 bedrooms there is also a loft area upstairs that can serve as a den, home office or a "man cave". There's lots of room inside the house including a wet bar that matches the updated kitchen with custom cabinets and granite countertops. The DOUBLE LOT has great outdoor living areas for lounging, grilling and relaxing in the very inviting swimming pool. There's a large covered terrace, a huge balcony off of the master suite that overlooks the backyard, a large storage shed, and room for a boat and/or an RV. So many details considered with the purpose of entertainment that they are too hard to mention. This is a must see\!
