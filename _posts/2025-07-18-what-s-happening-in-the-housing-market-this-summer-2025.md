This summer’s housing market feels like a riddle—prices are up, but competition is down. Mortgage rates dip, then spike, leaving buyers and sellers wondering: Is now the right time to move? The answer? It depends on what you know. Let’s break down the chaos and uncover the smartest strategies for navigating today’s unpredictable market.

Recently, we met with a client who shared the same sentiment. They were considering listing their home but worried the market might be too unpredictable. Like many others, they didn’t want to risk missing the right timing. We reviewed up-to-date local market data, including sales trends, inventory levels, and buyer behavior. That gave them the clarity they needed. Their home went live, and within a few days, it had multiple offers.

This summer, timing, preparation, and strategy matter more than ever. Whether you’re buying or selling, here are three real estate market trends you need to know:

**1\. Mortgage rates are dipping slightly.** Mortgage rates are currently hovering around [6\.8% to 7.1%](https://freddiemac.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/mortgage-rates-remain-essentially-flat), slightly lower than earlier this year, but still higher than pre-pandemic levels.

Rates have dipped slightly, but for buyers, it’s still not enough to address affordability concerns. Monthly payments are still high, so many are turning to rate buydowns or adjustable-rate loans just to make the numbers work. Pre-approval’s a start, but you’ll need a real plan to stay within budget.

This shift also matters for sellers. With picky buyers due to limited budgets, you need to price your home right. Offering incentives, such as covering closing costs, can make a significant difference.

**2\. Not all markets are created equal.** The market isn’t moving the same way everywhere. Some cities are experiencing [price increases of up to 9.4%](https://www.fingerlakes1.com/2025/06/04/housing-market-summer-2025-forecast/), while others are seeing a slight cooling off. That’s why it’s crucial to examine what’s happening in your neighborhood.

Cooling prices in certain areas could provide homebuyers with a rare opportunity. However, in high-demand neighborhoods, competition remains tough, especially where jobs are growing or new construction is limited. If you’re a seller, those same hot spots could work in your favor only if you price your home right. In slower markets, setting the right expectations matters.

Real estate has always been local, but now it’s hyper-local. What’s true across town might not apply on your street.

**3\. Inventory is trending upwards.** Inventory is starting to pick up, which means buyers have more options and more time to compare. But that also means sellers face more competition. In this kind of market, pricing too high is one of the quickest ways to get overlooked.

Buyers today are careful. They’re weighing every detail. For sellers, that means small things—like a clean space, fresh paint, or a pre-listing inspection—can make your home stand out. It doesn’t need to be perfect, but it does need to feel worth the price.

This summer’s housing market is all about being informed and strategic. Whether you’re considering buying, selling, or simply curious about your options, now’s the time to gather the facts and create a plan that aligns with your goals.
