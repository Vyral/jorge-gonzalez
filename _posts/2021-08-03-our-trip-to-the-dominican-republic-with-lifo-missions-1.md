I’m excited to announce that I’m about to embark on my fourth service trip to the Dominican Republic with LIFO (Living Instruments for Others) Missions. **We’re heading to a small village in the countryside in order to provide residents clean, running water, which is the primary mission of LIFO.&nbsp;**

I’ve gone with three of my children so far, and this year, I’m bringing along two of my daughters. It’s always a great bonding experience, and it gives us a look at how other cultures live each day. It’s eye-opening to see the types of struggles that people must go through when they don’t have basic needs like running water.

Serving others is part of our faith and tradition, and it’s also the foundation of our real estate business. **In addition to serving our clients, we do all we can to help those in our Miami community who are less fortunate.**
