I’m bringing you today’s message from within a beautiful, well-maintained listing that we just put on the market last Tuesday and started showing the following Wednesday. We used stellar photography and video, 3D virtual tour technology, and online resources to maximize exposure, and it’s all paid off; **in a four-day span, I showed the property to 32 different buyers.** I’ve already received seven offers, most of which are at asking price but a couple are even above it.&nbsp;

As I highlighted in a prior video, right now is it a great time to sell, and this listing is yet another prime example of that. However, all this action begs a more complicated question: Is now the right time to buy? My goal is never to tell you what you want to hear; as a professional, the recommendations I’d offer to a potential buyer client do not differ from the recommendations I’d offer to a close friend or family member.&nbsp;

**Cited below for your convenience are timestamps that will direct you to various points in the video. Feel free to watch the full message or use these timestamps to skip to topics that interest you most:&nbsp;**
