Building your own home can be a big undertaking, and when you're considering this option, as opposed to buying a finished house, you'll consider several factors like design features, cost to design, building quality and timeline. When it's completely said and done the numbers certainly add up, and you'll be looking at several additional months to a year before you can move into your new home. While you're looking at building your home, consider going modular. Far from the off-putting idea of living in a trailer or mobile home, prefab home design and construction has come a long way in the last decade, and there are some genuine advantages to selecting a modular home for your new property.&nbsp;

**Affordability.**Modular home builders are constructing multiple homes at the same time, in a controlled environment. They have readily available materials, workforce and time that cut down on the initial costs to build your home. Even with the expense of transporting the pieces of your home to your land modular homes are incredibly cost-effective. Whether you are looking for a home you can buy under 100k or looking to get a 12 million dollar mansion for 2 million dollars buying a prefab home helps you stay within your budget and get more bang for your buck.

**Timeline.**&nbsp;Your prefab home construction takes place in a controlled weather environment. Builders aren't subject to changes in weather that damage materials and delay deadlines. Unlike residential builders who specialize in stick-built homes, your modular home builder is building many houses at the same time, at the same location, so they usually have an abundance of materials on hand and recurring order and delivery dates with their suppliers. This process helps to prevent the delays caused by delayed deliveries to the build site, sold out suppliers or lack of accessibility to the build site. If an accelerated timeline is important to you a modular home can help you make that expedited move-in date.&nbsp;

**Quality control.**&nbsp;Here again, a controlled building environment is a tremendous positive of prefabricated homes. You don't have to worry about finding warped or rotted boards or a crew working through miserable weather. Prefab building facilities can employ more technology to assist builders and ensure exact measurements, cuts, and precision of craftsmanship. Stable factory conditions improve the health and safety of workers allowing them to produce their best work. As with all homes, your modular home will be reviewed by an independent inspector to make sure it meets all building codes.

If you've found a property that you like and are considering building your own home speak with your lending agent and realtor about your modular home building options.
