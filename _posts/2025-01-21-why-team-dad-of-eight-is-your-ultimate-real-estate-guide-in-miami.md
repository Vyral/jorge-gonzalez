Are you looking for a team of experts to guide your real estate journey? Let me introduce myself, Jorge Gonzalez, and my Team Dad of Eight. We’re a group of dedicated professionals proudly operating under Keller Williams Realty in Miami, Florida. Here’s a little more about us:

I began my real estate career in 1986, initially focusing on multifamily apartment buildings as both an investor and a realtor. Since 2013, I’ve specialized in residential real estate and small multifamily properties like duplexes and fourplexes. With hundreds of transactions completed, I use my decades of experience to provide expert guidance to my clients.

My wife, **Eva Gonzalez**, has been a licensed realtor since 1989. After raising our family of eight, she returned to real estate full-time 14 years ago. As a certified Keller Williams Estate Planner, Eva helps seniors with estate planning, downsizing, and 1031 exchanges. She also organizes community seminars on trusts, wills, and estate planning to support our community.

**Allie Gonzalez**, our daughter-in-law and married to our eldest son, joined our family business after starting her career as an animal trainer. She specializes in helping first-time homebuyers, renters, and investors. As a property investor herself, Allie brings a hands-on perspective to guide clients through their real estate journeys with confidence.

**Kathy Morales** recently became an official part of our team, though she’s been a behind-the-scenes powerhouse for years. She’s managed property showings, handled logistics, and ensured seamless support during transitions or scheduling challenges. Now, she’s stepping into a more prominent role to help us serve our clients even better.

Our mission is simple: to provide tailored, expert assistance in buying, selling, or investing. If you’re ready to take the next step in your real estate journey, visit our [website](https://dadof8realestate.com/) or email me at Jorge@DadOf8RealEstate.com. I look forward to hearing from you!
