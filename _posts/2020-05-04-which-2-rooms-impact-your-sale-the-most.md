If you plan to invest any time, money, and effort into making your home more appealing, **you’ll want to focus on two key areas: the kitchens and the bathrooms.** No matter what the house looks like as far as decor and style, an updated kitchen and bathroom will really pack a punch.

Let’s face it: When families gather together for parties or holidays, **they tend to congregate in the kitchen area**. That’s why it’s very popular nowadays to have an open kitchen concept where the kitchen actually shares space with family rooms and living rooms to allow people to flow to and fro. For that same reason, kitchen islands are also widely sought-after.

If you update your kitchen, **it doesn’t have to be with top-of-the-line materials and finishes.** By simply updating it with good, new materials that show off a modernized kitchen, you’ll get most of the money you spend back when you sell.

I recommend that sellers **go out and look at model homes in new developments**; that’s one way to see what currently appeals to homebuyers. Believe me, those builders invest a lot of money to investigate and research what buyers are looking for.

The same techniques that apply to the kitchen also apply to the bathrooms. Make some simple updates like new paint, tile, vanities, sinks, toilets, and/or tubs, and you’ll see the buyers come flocking to your listing.

If you have any questions about readying your home to sell for the most on the market, don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to speak with you.
