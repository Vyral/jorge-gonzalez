One wrong number can derail your home sale before it even starts. Pricing your home too high is not a small mistake; it can scare buyers away, help your competition, and cost you thousands. Here’s why overpricing is so risky and what you can do instead:

**1\. Overpricing shrinks your buyer pool.** Every day your home sits on the market, you lose potential buyers. Today, most buyers search online by budget. If your home is even $20,000 too high, it might not appear in their search results. As time goes on, serious buyers may wonder if there’s something wrong with your home, and interest drops even more.

**2\. Overpricing helps competing homes sell.** Buyers compare your home to others. If your home is the most expensive, it makes other homes look like better deals. Instead of getting offers, an overpriced listing can push buyers toward other properties, helping your competition.

**3\. A stale listing loses leverage.** Homes that stay on the market too long often have to drop the price to get attention again. Locally, homes that sit more than about 21 days can lose 5% or more. After 30 to 45 days, it can be even worse. Homebuyers are smart and often have agents who know the local market well, making overpricing even riskier.

**4\. Appraisals can stop your sale.** Even if a buyer agrees to your high price, the deal can fall apart if the home doesn’t appraise for that amount. Take note that lenders won’t approve a loan higher than the appraisal, and buyers may walk away or ask for a lower price. If that happens, it can put you back at square one, often with less power to negotiate.

**Price your home based on real data.** To sell fast and get the best price, you need a plan based on local sales, the current market, and your home’s condition. Pricing isn’t just about what your neighbor sold for last year. The right price can attract serious buyers from day one and sometimes even create multiple offers, with buyers willing to pay more.

Overpricing is one of the biggest mistakes a seller can make. Use real data, know your market, and price your home carefully. Doing this helps your home sell faster, attracts strong buyers, and protects your money.
