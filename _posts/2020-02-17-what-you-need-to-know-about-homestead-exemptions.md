If you’re a homeowner living in the state of Florida, you can file for a homestead exemption. **This means you can save on your property taxes,** but you have to file for this exemption to take advantage of it.&nbsp;

After you buy a house, you only have to file once. After that, you have the exemption as long as the house is your primary residence. If you buy a home with me, I’ll send you a reminder to file at the beginning of the year after you bought it. You have to be timely, though, because there’s a deadline to file for the previous year’s exemption, and that deadline in Miami and Broward County is March 1.&nbsp;

So if you bought a house last year, it’s your primary residence, and you’ve been living in it since January 1 of 2020, you qualify for the homestead exemption.&nbsp;

How much does it save on your property taxes? The homestead exemption is always worth $50,000, so if your home’s assessed value is $300,000, you’d only be taxed for $250,000. Depending on your municipality within the county, that could be a substantial amount since you’re carrying that exemption for however long you stay in the house.&nbsp;

In some situations, it’s a prerequisite for people to apply for additional exemptions. If you’re a widower with a homestead exemption, you’ll be eligible for additional benefits. Same goes if you’re blind or a disabled veteran. There are all kinds of exemptions you can qualify for, so if you’d like to know more, use the following links:

* [Broward County](https://bcpasecure.net/homesteadonline/web/index.aspx){: target="_blank"}

**If you don’t file by March 1, you have to wait until 2021 and miss out on a whole year’s worth of savings.** I don’t want that happening to you, so if you have questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to call or email me.
