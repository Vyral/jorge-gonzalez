        "content": "Two home improvements are actually disasters for your investment in your property. These two “improvements” may bring you joy, but they won’t earn you more money when you sell the home.1. Solar panels and impact-resistant windows. You may see ads in home improvement magazines promoting the installation of these to increase your house’s value. These are wonderful things to install if you want them, but they truly don’t substantially increase your property’s value. There’s even excellent financing for solar panels and these special windows if you desire them, so you may think that you’ll get your money back from these when it’s time to sell. These upgrades might be appealing to some homebuyers, but you probably won’t recapture your investment in them. Think about this carefully before installing solar panels or impact-resistant windows and doors.“If you want a pool, I recommend buying a house that already has one.”2. Pools. Here in South Florida, we love pools, but they aren’t necessarily a great investment for your home. If you want a pool, I recommend buying a house that already has one—in Florida, there are many. Today, the minimum cost of building a pool is $30,000 to $40,000 for a basic pool. It’ll cost you even more if you add any extra features like a whirlpool spa, waterfalls, or LED lighting.Most properties with pools only sell for an additional $10,000 to $20,000 at best. If you have a home with room for a pool and you absolutely want one, go ahead and build it because you’ll enjoy it with friends and family, but certainly not as an investment If you have further questions about today’s topic or anything else concerning real estate, give us a call or send us an email.

        "content": "If you plan to invest any time, money, and effort into making your home more appealing, you’ll want to focus on two key areas: the kitchens and the bathrooms. No matter what the house looks like as far as decor and style, an updated kitchen and bathroom will really pack a punch.Let’s face it: When families gather together for parties or holidays, they tend to congregate in the kitchen area. That’s why it’s very popular nowadays to have an open kitchen concept where the kitchen actually shares space with family rooms and living rooms to allow people to flow to and fro. For that same reason, kitchen islands are also widely sought-after.“It’s very popular nowadays to have an open kitchen concept.”If you update your kitchen, it doesn’t have to be with top-of-the-line materials and finishes. By simply updating it with good, new materials that show off a modernized kitchen, you’ll get most of the money you spend back when you sell.I recommend that sellers go out and look at model homes in new developments; that’s one way to see what currently appeals to homebuyers. Believe me, those builders invest a lot of money to investigate and research what buyers are looking for.The same techniques that apply to the kitchen also apply to the bathrooms. Make some simple updates like new paint, tile, vanities, sinks, toilets, and/or tubs, and you’ll see the buyers come flocking to your listing.If you have any questions about readying your home to sell for the most on the market, don’t hesitate to reach out.

        "category": "",
        "content": "No matter what’s going on in the world around us right now, some people need to sell their homes. With all the lockdown measures being taken across the country (and the world), you might wonder how selling a home would even be possible. Today I’ll share some key information you need to know about how to sell your home in the era of social distancing.Given that most people are staying home, the real estate process has had to largely become a virtual transaction. That affects how Realtors market homes. So what’s the new normal? Well, if everything is going online, that means that the online marketing tools we use have to be enhanced. Buyers need to be able to get a good feel of the house before actually going to look at the property. That necessitates three things if you want the best exposure for your property:  Better photography  Better videos  A better virtual experience. 3D home tours, with the right tools, allow buyers to “walk through the house” online so they can see the property and all its corners. They can even allow buyers to take measurements of different spaces.“We make sure that buyers come to the house wearing proper face masks, gloves, and shoe covers.”Showings have also had to change. For one, only serious buyers will be allowed to go to a showing. The new normal here involves thoroughly disinfecting the property before and after each showing and keeping in line with social distancing; this is especially important if the property isn’t currently vacant. We have also been going through the house to open all the interior doors. Why? So that we can instruct visiting buyers not to touch anything. If everything is already open and available for inspection, there is no need for them to physically handle anything. Further, we do not shake hands or hug any of our clients. We also make sure that buyers come to the house wearing proper face masks, gloves, and shoe covers so as not to track anything into the home.If you do need to sell your house, don’t worry; right now is a great time to sell your home. You can count on me to invest in the best measures to keep clients safe and healthy even as they finish their real estate transactions.Don’t hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or needs you have. In the meantime, keep yourself and your loved ones safe!",

        "content": "What will be the economic impact of the lockdown caused by the Coronavirus? How will this crisis affect YOU personally? The fact is that many people have already experienced a reduction in their income, and many more have or will lose their jobs and income altogether. You may be fearful about how you will make ends meet, and you are right to be concerned.If you have a mortgage, I’m sure you’re wondering how you will be able to make your monthly payment. Recently a relief bill was approved by Congress and signed by the President. The federal government’s stimulus bill, called the CARES Act, includes a feature allowing homeowners to skip mortgage payments without penalties. Traditionally, skipping your mortgage payments due to a hardship is done through what’s called a forbearance, which has its pros and cons to be careful with; the CARES Act allows for payment deferrals which may be a better solution.Here are some additional links that may be helpful:https://www.knowyouroptions.com/options-to-stay-in-your-home/overview/forbearancehttps://www.investopedia.com/how-to-get-mortgage-relief-4800539https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-forbearance-en-289/If you have any questions relating to your mortgage, or how the real estate market is faring, don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email at any time.

        "content": "Have you ever thought about selling your house, but think that you need to do some work to it before you sell? Today we’re talking about the pros and cons of making improvements and remodels on your home before you sell it.Many times, Realtors will encourage you to do some staging, which is a term for making your property look the best it can so you can get the highest price. Staging requires careful planning, and if your house is dated compared to what else is on the market, you’ll need to start the planning early. Realtors are generally happy to advise you to make any and every repair because that makes the property easier to sell. However, it’s not always in your best interest. I take a more consultative approach. The top price isn’t actually what matters. What really matters is what you net at the end of the transaction.“We want you to walk away with the highest net profit possible.”I’ve seen sellers spend $20,000 renovating their kitchen, but only sold their home for $10,000 more than they could have if they didn’t do anything. That’s a net loss. We don’t want that to happen to you.You need to know which home improvements are going to increase your ROI and your bottom line. The focus is not on the highest sale price, it’s on the highest net profit from the sale.Sometimes, you may just need some light enhancements and some deep cleaning. There are plenty of inexpensive things you can do to enhance your home’s value. I’ve seen many cases where a seller spends a lot of money and fixes up their house, but it’s not what the market likes. That’s another mistake you can avoid with careful planning.If you’re thinking about selling your home but you’re not sure what you need to do to prepare it, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I’d be happy to meet with you and discuss your personal situation.",

        "content": "If you’re a homeowner living in the state of Florida, you can file for a homestead exemption. This means you can save on your property taxes, but you have to file for this exemption to take advantage of it. After you buy a house, you only have to file once. After that, you have the exemption as long as the house is your primary residence. If you buy a home with me, I’ll send you a reminder to file at the beginning of the year after you bought it. You have to be timely, though, because there’s a deadline to file for the previous year’s exemption, and that deadline in Miami and Broward County is March 1. So if you bought a house last year, it’s your primary residence, and you’ve been living in it since January 1 of 2020, you qualify for the homestead exemption. “There’s a deadline to file for the previous year’s exemption, and that deadline in Miami and Broward County is March 1.”How much does it save on your property taxes? The homestead exemption is always worth $50,000, so if your home’s assessed value is $300,000, you’d only be taxed for $250,000. Depending on your municipality within the county, that could be a substantial amount since you’re carrying that exemption for however long you stay in the house. In some situations, it’s a prerequisite for people to apply for additional exemptions. If you’re a widower with a homestead exemption, you’ll be eligible for additional benefits, as is also the case for blind people and disabled veterans.There are all kinds of exemptions you can qualify for, so if you’d like to know more, use the following links to file for your homestead exemption:  Miami-Dade County  Broward CountyIf you don’t file by March 1, you have to wait until 2021 and miss out on a whole year’s worth of savings. I don’t want that happening to you, so if you have questions about this topic, don’t hesitate to call or email me.Likewise, if you have any other real estate needs, feel free to reach out to me as well.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "What is the federal funds rate and why is it always talked about so much? How does it impact you as a buyer or seller?The federal funds rate is basically an interest rate charged between banks when they lend each other money overnight. This is an important rate because it’s guided and set by the Federal Reserve. A lot of people assume that when the federal funds rate goes up or down, mortgage rates follow suit. The truth, though, is that rarely happens. The federal funds rate rarely has a direct impact on mortgage rates. Sometimes, they go in opposite directions. If you’re interested in knowing what mortgage rates will do and how that will affect your buying or selling plans, the 10-Year Treasury note is the rate you want to follow. It’s a short-term rate that pays interest at a fixed rate once every six months, and it ties in almost exactly with where mortgage rates for a 30-year loan will be. What’s interesting about this is when interest rates are expected to rise, people assume home prices might fall. That’s possible—unless your mortgage rate is pretty low, you probably don’t like to hear that mortgage rates are going up. However, if you’re thinking about buying another house and want to sell your current one, that house suddenly becomes less affordable to buyers. “The federal funds rate rarely has a direct impact on mortgage rates.”On the other hand, when mortgage rates drop, people get excited because they think they can afford a house, so more buyers rush the market. That demand boosts home prices, and since existing buyers think they can afford higher-priced homes, that increases prices even further. So, if you’re a seller, should you sell in 2020 or stay put? I’ll say this: There is a likelihood that interest rates for mortgages creep up, because lenders are dying to push rates up a little bit. Don’t pay much attention to the federal funds rate, though. If you want to talk more about your goals for 2020 and whether it’s best to sell now or later, give me a call. We’ll examine the micro-trends of your specific marketplace and decide what’s best. I look forward to hearing from you.",

        "content": "Navigating a multiple-offer situation as a seller is always a nice problem to have. In those situations, my job as the Realtor is to first notify the seller that there are multiple offers on the table. From there, we have a couple of options for how to handle the buyers. We could simply choose an offer we like and accept it, but we want to see if that offer was really the buyer’s best one. We can’t really respond to more than one offer because of the possibility that more than one buyer will accept your counteroffer (naturally, you can’t go around promising one house to multiple people). “An auction atmosphere really creates a fervor that causes people to bid higher than they ever thought they would.”To make sure each buyer is putting their best foot forward, we inform all of them that the seller is welcoming the buyers’ final and best offers, which must be submitted within 24 hours. This essentially initiates a silent bid amongst the buyers. An auction atmosphere really creates a fervor that causes people to bid higher than they ever thought they would. Once the time frame is up and we’ve received each buyer’s final and best offer, we can start the decision-making process. We’ll sit down with you and scrutinize every offer. Remember, you can even counter the highest offer among all of those final offers. Maybe you want to try to refine some of the terms involved—you always have that power. Whatever the case, I’ll be there as your partner, making sure we take advantage of the best strategy to get top dollar for your property.

How should you proceed?I was recently working with some clients who were looking to make the leap to homeownership. After two months, we found the perfect home for them. When they finally saw the property in person, there was a huge crowd at the open house. I told them at that point there would probably be multiple offers on the property, so we need to put our best foot forward in the initial offer. “A low appraisal gives buyers more negotiation power.”In a situation like this, a lowball offer simply won’t work. Somebody is going to offer the full price, and maybe even offer above it. However, a full-priced offer won’t always work. Sometimes you’ll need to be generous on terms or offer more than the asking price.In a seller’s market like this, I always recommend this strategy to get the property under contract. Once it’s under contract, there are certain places where we can negotiate to get you a little bit better deal. One example is a low appraisal, which gives us a lot more negotiation power.If you are in the market to buy a house and you’re confronted with a situation like this, give me a call or send me an email.

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": " Whenever people ask me how the market is, I always tell them the same thing: It depends. Specifically, it depends on whether you’re buying or selling. If you’re selling, it depends how your home is priced. Real estate is local. In fact, I would call it sub-local. What’s the difference between a buyer’s market and a seller’s market, then? A buyer’s market simply means buyers have more control, and a seller’s market means sellers have more control. There are several important statistics agents look at to distinguish one from the other. The first metric is the homes’ average days on market, or how long properties in a specific neighborhood stay on the market before going under contract. If the average is short, that’s an indication of a seller’s market. If the average is long, that means buyers have more control. “If a lot of sellers are lowering the prices on their homes, it means they’re trying to entice buyers, which is a sure sign of a buyer’s market.”We also look at the absorption rate (aka inventory), which measures how long it would take to sell all available homes on the market if no new homes were listed. If the absorption rate is five months or less, it’s considered a seller’s market. Six months is considered a balanced market. Anything higher than that is considered a buyer’s market. Another factor I keep an eye on is price movement on the MLS. If a lot of sellers are lowering the prices on their homes, it means they’re trying to entice buyers, which is a sure sign of a buyer’s market. If you’d like to know what your home is worth or whether you’re in a buyer’s or seller’s market, give me a call and I’d be happy to run the numbers for you.

Make a ChecklistYou know you want to buy a luxury home in Florida, but you still have no idea where exactly you want to reside in the Sunshine State or what you want to find in your dream residence. If you create a homebuying checklist, however, you can hone your Florida luxury home search.First, consider where you want to live in Florida. If you enjoy Miami’s beaches, for example, you may want to search for luxury residences in or near the city itself. Or, if you want convenient access to Disney World, you may want to pursue a luxury home in the Orlando area.Don’t forget to consider the features you want in your ideal Florida luxury home, either. If you make a list of Sunshine State luxury house must-haves, you can search for properties that include these features. And as a result, you may be able to speed up your Florida luxury house search.2. Examine Your Short- and Long-Term GoalsThink about why you are pursuing a Florida luxury home in the first place. Next, you can take an objective view of a Sunshine State luxury house to determine if this residence will be able to serve you well both now and in the future.Oftentimes, it helps to consider your short- and long-term goals as you assess Florida luxury houses. If you want to start a family soon, for instance, you may want to search for luxury houses near some of Florida’s top parks and schools. On the other hand, if you aspire to work in Jacksonville, you may want to consider luxury residences in the Jacksonville area.3. Perform an InspectionIf you find a Florida luxury home you want to buy and a seller accepts your offer to purchase, you should conduct an inspection. That way, you can gain comprehensive insights to help you determine if a house is right for you.During a home inspection, a property expert will analyze all areas of a Florida luxury house. He or she then will provide you with an inspection report that you can use to decide whether to continue with a home purchase.Lastly, you may want to hire a real estate agent before you launch a Florida luxury house search.

In fact, if you use common sense during your home search, you should have no trouble achieving your desired homebuying results.Now, let’s take a look at three tips to help you discover your dream home.1. Consider Your Home Must-HavesYou know you want to purchase a house, but you still have no idea what defines your ideal residence. However, if you devote time and resources to establish home must-haves, you could speed up your house search.Think about what will make you happy and what you need from a house. For example, if you want to own a home that is close to your office in the city, you can narrow your home search to residences in or near the city itself. On the other hand, if you require a home that offers multiple bedrooms, you can explore residences that match your needs.2. Create a BudgetA budget often plays a key role in the homebuying journey. And if you fail to create a budget before you start a house search, you risk checking out residences that fall outside your price range.To establish a homebuying budget, you should consider your current and future expenses. It may be helpful to make a list of your expenses and compare them against your income. Then, you can determine exactly how much you can afford to pay for a home.You may want to get pre-approved for a mortgage, too. If you enter the housing market with a mortgage in hand, you can search exclusively for houses that you can afford.3. Work with a Real Estate AgentThere is no reason to search for your dream home on your own. If you hire a real estate agent, you can receive comprehensive guidance as you explore houses in your preferred cities and towns.Typically, a real estate agent is willing to go the extra mile to help you achieve the best-possible results. If you want to purchase a home near a beach, for example, a real estate agent can help you do just that. Conversely, if you want to acquire a top-notch house as quickly as possible, a real estate agent will help you accelerate the homebuying cycle.Let’s not forget about the assistance that a real estate agent can provide as you weigh the pros and cons of submitting an offer to purchase a home, either. If you find a home you may want to buy, a real estate agent can help you determine the best course of action. And if you decide to submit a homebuying proposal, a real estate agent will help you craft a competitive offer to purchase.Want to acquire your dream home?

        "content": "Getting your home ready to sell involves more than just packing all of your property in boxes and leaving. It begins right from the time you move in. Often it even starts before you buy another home. Many people rely on money from the sale of their home to buy their next home. If you are in this category, beginning the process early will help increase your profits.Do not panic; this article will walk you through the entire process. To start with, there are some improvements you can make to your property to make it sell faster. This is what you will see throughout this article.Improvements You Should Make on Your HomeAlmost all homes require some extra love and care, and this is the reason why you need to start this process early. The kind of improvement we are talking about here are those things that will bring up the value of your home. How do you do it?First, critically look at your house and take inventory of all the repairs needed. Spend around two weekends to looking for easy things such as touching up paint and patching nail holes, but plan for more time to check out more substantial projects like the roof or foundation.The critical areas of your home are the kitchen and bathrooms, so start your improvements there first. Updating these areas of your home can include replacing hardware, painting the cabinets, or hanging new light fixtures.You should keep an eye out for anything you think might need a bit of work while making these improvements. These improvements should not cost you millions of dollars, but completing these repairs before you list your house for sale will show that you are able and even ready to make more money on the home.Find out the Fair Market Value of Your PropertyThe fair market value of your home can best be described as the price that a home buyer would pay readily without any pressure from outside sources. The price can be influenced by many factors such as the appraisal, tax assessment, and homes in that area.  The bank or the buyers’ lender usually completes the appraisal to ensure the value is in the home before they buy the property.  The tax assessment is an estimated value based on information the government has on your property without really seeing the inside of your home.  Finding your house’s value based on others in the area is referred to as a Comparative Marketing Analysis (CMA).Comparative Marketing AnalysisA CMA looks at properties that have the same square footage and similar features to determine a sale price for your home. A full CMA also considers some other factors such as houses that have been sold recently or those that listed for sale at the moment, their duration on the market, and how they compare with your listing.The value of your property may rise and fall depending on a lot of things: the area, the local market, and the season in which you are trying to sell to name a few. It is good to have a real estate agent who knows your particular area complete your CMA. They have a more complete vision of the market you are in and will be able to price your home cleverly at the spot where it will sell fast for the highest value.Selling your home can take a toll on your patience if you are not prepared beforehand, but knowing and completing these steps in advance will make the process a smooth one. So, get out there and get your house ready for sale!",

Homebuying can also be an enjoyable experience if you put in steps to get ready for the process well before it gets started.Here are four things that you must do to prepare for buying a home.Check your credit reportThe most critical factor in buying a home is your credit report. This report is what mortgage lenders use to determine your eligibility for a mortgage loan. Many things affect your credit report and add up to your credit score. Find a free or paid website to check your credit report at least twice a year.Build your credit history by also making sure that you don’t default on credit card payments and other bills. If you already have delinquent accounts on your credit report, work with the creditor to bring it back up to date. If there are mistakes on your report, contact the reporting credit bureau to address it. Have a budgetBudgets come out of taking a long, hard look at your current financial situation and deciding how much down payment you can afford to pay. Your economic condition affects the type of home that you can buy and your ability to pay your mortgage conveniently. Also, try to budget for other expenses like homeowners’ insurance, closing fees, inspections, and possible renovations or improvements. Use a mortgage calculator online or with your real estate agent to play around with the amounts to find the sweet spot for you.Get pre-approved for a mortgage loanBefore you start looking for a house, you should get pre-approved by your bank. Not only does this give you a stamp of approval that you are ready to buy a home, but it also gives you an edge over other buyers as the sellers know there will be a quick closing on the sale.Find a Real estate agentNavigating the real estate market by yourself is not advisable. Many pitfalls exist of which you may not be aware. To make your dream of owning a home a reality, find a real estate agent that is professional, has your best interest at heart and honest. This person will help you get the best deal for your money and also have a smooth buying process.Do you think now you are ready to buy your first home?

Cleaning your house is a pretty easy task to procrastinate because it usually takes so much time and energy from your already busy lifestyle. Of course, everyone within your household enjoys a tidy living space, but no one is up for the job. Believe it or not, some things you can do right now to keep your home tidy and relaxing every day of the week!  Everything has a place. Assign each item a place and ensure that everyone in your household knows where those items go. For example: Where do shoes go when your family gets home from work or school? Is there a place by the door or do they go in the bedroom? Create a designated area for those items, and your home will maintain organization throughout the week.  Create a chore list that assigns small chores each day rather than cleaning every surface in one day. For instance: Mondays can be the day everyone dusts their bedrooms, Tuesdays give someone the task of vacuuming the living area and so on. By doing a little now and then, you maintain your homes ability to remain a relaxing environment.  Make cleaning a family activity. It can be hard to get the kids motivated to clean their rooms, but when everyone in the household is doing their part, kids can quickly jump on board. Something you could start is “The five-minute pick-up game.” Set a timer for five minutes each day and ask that everyone tidy up their space for five minutes. Setting a limit will not only keep you from a few meltdowns but will also save you so much time that you could be spending on the couch resting!  Once a month go through your home and declutter a room. It’s so easy to collect unwanted items that pile up in a closet to collect dust, but you can save yourself the stress later by organizing one room each month. Declutter by asking yourself when the last time you used the item, and if you plan to use it anytime soon. If you no longer have a specific use for the article, then donate it to someone in need.  As you take a few minutes during each day to clean your home, you will save yourself so much time throughout the week that you can spend enjoying time with your friends and family.",

        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "Building your own home can be a big undertaking, and when you’re considering this option, as opposed to buying a finished house, you’ll consider several factors like design features, cost to design, building quality and timeline. When it’s completely said and done the numbers certainly add up, and you’ll be looking at several additional months to a year before you can move into your new home. While you’re looking at building your home, consider going modular. Far from the off-putting idea of living in a trailer or mobile home, prefab home design and construction has come a long way in the last decade, and there are some genuine advantages to selecting a modular home for your new property. Affordability.Modular home builders are constructing multiple homes at the same time, in a controlled environment. They have readily available materials, workforce and time that cut down on the initial costs to build your home. Even with the expense of transporting the pieces of your home to your land modular homes are incredibly cost-effective. Whether you are looking for a home you can buy under 100k or looking to get a 12 million dollar mansion for 2 million dollars buying a prefab home helps you stay within your budget and get more bang for your buck.Timeline. Your prefab home construction takes place in a controlled weather environment. Builders aren’t subject to changes in weather that damage materials and delay deadlines. Unlike residential builders who specialize in stick-built homes, your modular home builder is building many houses at the same time, at the same location, so they usually have an abundance of materials on hand and recurring order and delivery dates with their suppliers. This process helps to prevent the delays caused by delayed deliveries to the build site, sold out suppliers or lack of accessibility to the build site. If an accelerated timeline is important to you a modular home can help you make that expedited move-in date. Quality control. Here again, a controlled building environment is a tremendous positive of prefabricated homes. You don’t have to worry about finding warped or rotted boards or a crew working through miserable weather. Prefab building facilities can employ more technology to assist builders and ensure exact measurements, cuts, and precision of craftsmanship. Stable factory conditions improve the health and safety of workers allowing them to produce their best work. As with all homes, your modular home will be reviewed by an independent inspector to make sure it meets all building codes.If you’ve found a property that you like and are considering building your own home speak with your lending agent and realtor about your modular home building options.",

        "title": "How Good is Your Homeowners' Insurance?",
        "author": "",
        "category": "",
        "content": "You found the right house, put in the new carpet, buffed the wood floors and moved in all your belongings. Then one day after being out with your family, you come home to find all your sewer pipes backed up and an inch of water in the bathroom and creeping out into that new carpet. You have company coming this weekend, but it’s okay, you just call Hank your insurance agent, and it will all be taken care of, right? Wrong. Most policies don’t actually cover sewer damage. That’s Right! No CoverageReading through the fine print of your insurance policy is important. Many things that new homeowners assume are covered turn out to be extra or not even available in the first place.  Sewer Backup: As a sewer system ages it becomes more prone to blockages and bursting pipes which can leave you in the lurch. Sewage issues are rarely covered in homeowners’ insurance and usually require an extra specific endorsement. If you don’t have that additional coverage, all those repair and replacement costs will come out of your own pocket.  Termites: Termites love wood. When they move into your home, they eat away at walls, support beams and any other wooden parts of your home. Termites cause over $5 billion in damage across the united states each year. It’s next to impossible to get a policy that covers termites, so keep an eye out for the signs and practice preventative pest control.  Mold: Underneath the paint, behind the tub, around the floorboards – there are many places that mold likes to make its home. Over a thousand varieties, with some causing significant health risks like black mold, everyone is susceptible to a mold infestation. Most policies that include mold coverage have severe restrictions on its possible sources and max out at around $10,000 or so in coverage. That may sound like a lot, but mold damage can easily be more than that. Just think about replacing half the walls in your home in addition to the expensive treatment that prevents it from coming back.  Flooding: A variety of water-related issues can cause flooding in your home. Some of them are covered, but flooding from hurricanes, heavy rain or tropical storms is usually not included. If you live in a storm-prone area, check to see if your community participates in NFIP, the National Flood Insurance Program. NFIP municipalities are required to meet FEMA preparedness requirements by putting resources into flood prevention. If your community participates, you are eligible for the NFIP coverage.  Earthquakes and Sinkholes: Earthquakes and other ground movement such as sinkholes are not covered by the majority of policies. If you live near a water table, or on top of certain kinds of rock, your property may be prone to sinkholes. If one opens up beneath your home, the damage can be incredible. Check with your policyholder to see if additional earthquake and ground movement coverage is available for your property. Make sure to talk to your insurance agent about all your needs and questions to get the right policy for your situation. Not sure what questions to ask? Your real estate agent will know what dangers your property is prone to.",
