Will mortgage interest rates go up or down in 2021? What would be the market consequences of either scenario? Unfortunately, we don’t have a crystal ball to see into, so arriving at a definitive answer is impossible. We are, however, equipped with a decade’s worth of market data proving a strong correlation between the 30-year fixed mortgage rate and the 10-year Treasury constant maturity rate, or Treasury bills, which are sometimes referred to as “T-bills.” Today I want to bring to your attention an interesting recent divergence in that correlation and share my own prediction for what rates will do this year. In short, they’ll stay low, but not for lack of upward pressure.
