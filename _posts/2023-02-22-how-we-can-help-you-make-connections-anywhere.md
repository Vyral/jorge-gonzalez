Today we are excited to be coming to you from Anaheim California for the Keller Williams Family Reunion event. It is held every year and helps me make great connections with agents from all over the world. If you or someone you know is moving to somewhere outside of Miami, we can still help you because we have these connections.&nbsp;

This event hosted over 15,000 Keller Williams agents, and all of them meant more connections for us to make as a service to you. **As a part of the Keller Willams organization, we can connect you with a professional agent from any area.&nbsp;**

Through Keller Williams Command, we can look up agents from all over and vet them by how much training they have, how long they’ve been in the business, how many transactions they’ve done, how much education they’ve gone through, and more. Then we can call them and get to know them to help you identify if they are the right fit for you.&nbsp;

If we connect a client with an agent, we get a referral fee from them. **Then you get connected with someone great and get better service.** If this is something you’re interested in, please don’t hesitate to reach out! Call or email us anytime, and we would be happy to connect you.
