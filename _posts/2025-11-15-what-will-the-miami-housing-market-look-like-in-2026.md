Are you starting to wonder what the housing market will look like next year? In 2025, homebuyers and sellers in Miami are worried about a crash, but they don’t want to miss out on better timing either.

After reviewing current trends and expert forecasts, I noted three key trends that I believe could shape real estate in 2026:

**1\. Modest growth, not wild swings in home prices.** Don’t expect big drops or jumps. According to Zillow, home prices are expected to rise about 0.4% nationwide from mid-2025 through mid-2026. That’s a slower pace than we've seen in the past few years, but still a sign of steady movement rather than a freeze.

In some areas, prices may even cool slightly, especially where affordability has become a challenge. But in growing metros and popular suburban areas, demand remains strong enough to keep values up. The key takeaway? We’re heading toward a more stable market, not a sharp correction or sudden spike.

**2\. Sales activity set to rebound if rates improve.** After two slow years, there’s hope for a sales rebound in 2026. It’s forecasted that there’s going to be up to a 14% increase in home sales next year, and a 9.6% bump in existing home transactions. However, both forecasts come with a condition: interest rates must ease.

As of late 2025, mortgage rates remain near 7%. If they begin to dip closer to the mid-6% range or lower, that could unlock demand from buyers who’ve been priced out. More affordable borrowing means more purchasing power. That shift alone could bring momentum back into many markets, especially mid-tier homes and entry-level price points.

**3\. Inventory and buyer power may slowly return.** Inventory remains tight, but change could be coming. Many current homeowners are holding on to ultra-low interest rates from years past. But as rates begin to soften, more may feel ready to list. Some forecasts suggest we’ll see gradual growth in new listings as the “lock-in effect” weakens.

For buyers, more inventory means more choices and possibly fewer bidding wars.

For sellers, that means standing out will take more than just a listing; it’ll take pricing strategy, prep work, and flexibility.

If supply grows while demand remains steady, buyers could finally regain some leverage, especially in markets where listings have been tight for too long.

**Fair forecast.** The 2026 housing market won’t look like the past few years, and that’s a good thing. We’re likely headed into a period of more balance, where buyers and sellers both have room to act. The key will be understanding your timing, your local market, and how national trends might shape your next move.
