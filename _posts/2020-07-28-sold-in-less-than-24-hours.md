I’m standing outside of a marvelous listing in Coral Gables, Florida, which is the metropolitan area of Miami known for its elegant style and beautiful landscaping. This property certainly fits the area, as its landscaping and backyard pool offer resort living at its finest. That being said, I’m only showing you this property because it—like so many others—is proof that our market has heated up in the months since COVID hit.&nbsp;

**Right now is a great time to sell your house.** If you were planning to sell next year, or in the next two to three years, I’d ask you to challenge your thinking; **could you modify your plans to take advantage of this hot market’s unique conditions?&nbsp;**

Last Friday, the property in this video went live on the market. We marketed it in proper COVID-era fashion: awesome photos and videos, 3D Matterport virtual tours, and detailed floor plans. In other words, **we did everything necessary to make sure that people could see the house and all that it offers without having to physically step inside.** The only people who see the insides of homes in person are those who have seen all the photos, watched all the videos, and taken the virtual tours; we want to make sure that the folks who walk into a home are only doing so to confirm what they’ve already seen before making their offer.

Before I went to bed last Friday, I already had two offers come in, one of which I sent to the sellers for review. They countered, and that counteroffer was ultimately accepted, but not before I received a bunch of appointment requests from interested buyers Saturday morning. **This property went under contract in less than 24 hours at top dollar\!**

Someone who submitted an offer on Saturday morning said they’d be willing to be the backup offer if given the opportunity to view the house in person. Immediately prior to shooting this video, I had shown the house, and it looks like they’ll soon be submitting an official backup offer.

If you’re a buyer in today’s market, you have to be aggressive. You need to be able to make offers quickly. If you’re not willing to make offers sight unseen, then you need to be doing everything you can to get yourself into that home before someone else wins out.&nbsp;

Sellers, welcome to a fast ride. You’ll be able to sell your house in record time and for top dollar. If you’re considering selling, I advise you to give me a call, text, or email. I’d love to be able to discuss options with you and help maximize your sale.
